# This directory is a copy of this one : charmm36-mar2014.ff

# Name of the residue: PT2 for phosphotyrosine 2- (at first I adopted the
# Swiss notation (PTR2) but the visualisation with VMD is problematic with
# this notation). (And the notation TP2 in the Charmm article already exists)
# For the other names, I adopted the Swiss parameter notation for the phospate part
# OH/OCC, P/PO4, and O1P,O2P,O3P/OC (because the PT2 part in merged.rtp is a
# copy of the Swiss parameter (residue PTR2 in the Swiss notation))
# For the rest of the tyrosine parameters, we use the Charmm/Gromacs notation
# For example, the merged.rtp parameters are a copy/paste for the Swiss
# parameters file (aminoacids.rtp) and I just had to change:
 - the charges on the atoms (CZ, OH, P, O1P, O2P, O3P) in adequation with ref.
   JACS, 127, 4641(2005):
   Here are the 6 changes compare to tyrosine:
	CZ	CA	-0.2800 16
	OH	OCC	-0.2800	17
	P	PO4	1.4400	18
	O1P	OC	-0.9600	19
	O2P	OC	-0.9600	20
	O3P	OC	-0.9600	21

########## WARNING     ###########
# Previously, I made a mistake. I forgot to change 4 charges:
    CE1 CA  -0.210
    CE2 CA  -0.210
    HE1 CA   0.210
    HE2 CA   0.210
########## WARNING END ###########



 - some atom types of the tyrosine part are changed in the Swiss notation. I
   changed them back to their charmm/gromacs notation: (see the names for
   tyrosine in merged.rtp) (ATTENTION: name directly for Charmm are a bit
   different from the notation in Gromacs (charmm/gromacs))
   HB -> HB1
   HA -> HA2
   HA -> HA2

# In the file ../residuetypes.dat
# I added the PT2 reference

# .hdb file (hydrogens to be able to be added to your residue):
# PT2: we use the same data of TYR and just delete the last line which
# corresponds to the hydrogen on the oxygen atom (now the oxygen is linked to
# PO3)

# ffbonded.itp
sections :  bond
            angle
            dihedral
# first parameters in each section correspond to parameters of phophotyrosine

# ffnonbonded.itp
Just 2 new parameters PO4 and OCC (OC already existsand is equivalenet to the
ON3 charmm parameter). PO4 and OCC are copy of P and ON2. The parameters are
transferrable

# atomtypes.atp
Just 2 new parameters PO4 and OCC (OC already here is equivalenet to the
ON3 charmm parameter). PO4 and OCC are copy of P and ON2. The parameters are
transferrable

See these files:
- merged.rtp (charges / bonds/ impropers) - the data comes from the file
  output_pdb.rtp in the directory STLC (see the file notes.txt there)
- merged.hdb (written manually - H atoms construction for pdb2gmx)
- atomtypes.atp (new atom type - I don't have to add any new types, all the atoms are already in the database)
- ffnonbonded.itp (idem) 
- ffbonded.itp (I add to add some paramters from zzd.prm)

One problem with this is that the CGenFF/Vitaly parameter have determined from a mol2
file coming form the database ZINC and the atom names are not the same as the
one in the pdb file.
So I changed the atom names in the file with those from the PDB + a
appropriate names for the hydrogen atoms that suits the Gromacs (pdb2gmx)
rules. (See the STLC directory)
